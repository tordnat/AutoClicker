# AutoClicker

Sit is stupid. 

This code modifies the alarm-clock example-file from the ds3231-library to trigger a stepper motor that again clicks on a timed thermostat, because SIT is stupid. 

# Hardware

* Arduino Pro Micro
* ZS-042 RTC-module (not for simple)
* 28byj-48 steppermotor (and driver)
